# Long Range Gates

## Installation
Set up with `pdm` so that you can just run `pdm install` in the directory if you have PDM.
Then you can run it in the PDM virtual environment with `eval $(pdm venv activate)`.

Otherwise, make sure you have `qiskit`, `qiskit_aer`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy` installed in your environment.

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run ghz.py in your environment with `python ghz.py`.
